test_that("attachments", {
  # tests for the property `attachments` (map(SubscriptionsAttachments))
  # The set of bundle metadata items to be included in the payload of a notification request to a subscription endpoint. Each property in this object represents an attachment to the notification payload. Each attachment will be a child property of the &#x60;attachments&#x60; property of the payload. The name of such a child property can be chosen freely provided it does not start with an underscore. For example, if the subscription is &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; {   \&quot;attachments\&quot;: {     \&quot;taxon\&quot;: {       \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;jmespath\&quot;,       \&quot;expression\&quot;: \&quot;files.biomaterial_json.biomaterials[].content.biomaterial_core.ncbi_taxon_id[]\&quot;     }   } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; the corresponding notification payload will contain the following entry &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; \&quot;attachments\&quot;: {   \&quot;taxon\&quot;: [9606, 9606] } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; If a general error occurs during the processing of attachments, the notification will be sent with &#x60;attachments&#x60; containing only the reserved &#x60;_errors&#x60; attachment containing a string describing the error. If an error occurs during the processing of a specific attachment, the notification will be sent with all successfully processed attachments and additionally the &#x60;_errors&#x60; attachment containing an object with one property for each failed attachment. For example, &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; \&quot;attachments\&quot;: {   \&quot;taxon\&quot;: [9606, 9606]   \&quot;_errors\&quot; {     \&quot;biomaterial\&quot;: \&quot;Some error occurred\&quot;   } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; The value of the &#x60;attachments&#x60; property must be less than or equal to 128 KiB in size when serialized to JSON and encoded as UTF-8. If it is not, the notification will be sent with &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; \&quot;attachments\&quot;: {   \&quot;_errors\&quot;: \&quot;Attachments too large (131073 bytes)\&quot; } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

  # The subscriber\\&#39;s URL. An HTTP request is made to the specified URL for every attempt to deliver a notification to the subscriber.

Otherwise, more attempts will be made with an exponentially increasing delay between attempts, until an attempt is successful or the a maximum number of attempts is reached.
