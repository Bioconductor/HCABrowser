  # tests for SearchPost
  # base path: https://dss.data.humancellatlas.org/v1
  # Find bundles by searching their metadata with an Elasticsearch query 
  # Accepts Elasticsearch JSON query and returns matching bundle identifiers # Index design The metadata seach index is implemented as a [document-oriented database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database) using [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/). The index stores all information relevant to a bundle within each bundle document, largely eliminating the need for [object-relational mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping). This design is optimized for queries that filter the data.  To illustrate this concept, say our index stored information on three entities, &#x60;foo&#x60;, &#x60;bar&#x60;, and &#x60;baz&#x60;. A foo can have many bars and bars can have many bazes. If we were to index bazes in a document-oriented design, the information on the foo a bar comes from and the bazes it contains are combined into a single document. A example sketch of this is shown below in [JSON-schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#JSON_Schema). &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; {   \&quot;definitions\&quot;: {     \&quot;bar\&quot;: {       \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;object\&quot;,       \&quot;properties\&quot;: {         \&quot;uuid\&quot;: {           \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;string\&quot;,           \&quot;format\&quot;: \&quot;uuid\&quot;         },         \&quot;foo\&quot;: {           \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;object\&quot;,           \&quot;properties\&quot;: {             \&quot;uuid\&quot;: {               \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;string\&quot;,               \&quot;format\&quot;: \&quot;uuid\&quot;             },             ...           }         },         \&quot;bazes\&quot;: {           \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;array\&quot;,           \&quot;items\&quot;: {             \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;string\&quot;,             \&quot;format\&quot;: \&quot;uuid\&quot;           }         },         ...       }     }   } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; This closely resembles the structure of DSS bundle documents: projects have many bundles and bundles have many files. Each bundle document is a concatenation of the metadata on the project it belongs to and the files it contains. # Limitations to index design There are limitations to the design of DSS&#39;s metadata search index. A few important ones are listed below. * [Joins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)) between bundle metadata must be conducted client-side * Querying is schema-specific; fields or values changed between schema version will break queries that use those fields and values * A new search index must be built for each schema version * A lot of metadata is duplicated between documents
