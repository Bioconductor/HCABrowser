    "As organisms age, cells accumulate genetic and epigenetic changes that eventually lead to impaired organ function or catastrophic failure such as cancer. Here we describe a single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2544 human pancreas cells from donors, spanning six decades of life. We find that islet cells from older donors have increased levels of disorder as measured both by noise in the transcriptome and by the number of cells which display inappropriate hormone expression, revealing a transcriptional instability associated with aging. By analyzing the spectrum of somatic mutations in single cells from previously-healthy donors, we find a specific age-dependent mutational signature characterized by C to A and C to G transversions, indicators of oxidative stress, which is absent in single cells from human brain tissue or in a tumor cell line. Cells carrying a high load of such mutations also express higher levels of stress and senescence markers, including FOS, JUN, and the cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase SOD1, markers previously linked to pancreatic diseases with substantial age-dependent risk, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and adenocarcinoma. Thus, our single-cell approach unveils gene expression changes and somatic mutations acquired in aging human tissue, and identifies molecular pathways induced by these genetic changes that could influence human disease. Also, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using single-cell RNA-seq data from primary cells to derive meaningful insights into the genetic processes that operate on aging human tissue and to determine which molecular mechanisms are coordinated with these processes. Examination of single cells from primary human pancreas tissue",
    "The cancer microenvironment is a complex ecosystem characterized by dynamic interactions between diverse cell types, including malignant, immune and stromal cells. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on CD45+ and CD45- cells isolated from tumour and lymph nodes during a mouse model of melanoma. The transcriptional profiles of these individual cells taken at different time points coupled with assembled T cell receptor sequences, allowed us to identify distinct immune subpopulations and delineate their developmental trajectory. Our study provides insights into the complex interplay among cells within the tumour microenvironment and presents a valuable resource for future translational applications.",
    "We used single-cell RNA-sequencing to generate transcriptional profiles of endocrine and exocrine cell types of the human pancreas. Pancreatic tissue and islets were obtained from six healthy and four T2D cadaveric donors. Islets were cultured and dissociated into single-cell suspension. Viable individual cells were distributed via fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) into 384-well plates containing lysis buffer. Single-cell cDNA libraries were generated using the Smart-seq2 protocol. Gene expression was quantified as reads per kilobase transcript and per million mapped reads (RPKM) using rpkmforgenes. Bioinformatics analysis was used to classify cells into cell types without knowledge of cell types or prior purification of cell populations. We revealed subpopulations in endocrine and exocrine cell types, identified genes with interesting correlations to body mass index (BMI) in specific cell types and found transcriptional alterations in T2D.  Complementary whole-islet RNA-seq data have also been deposited at ArrayExpress under accession number E-MTAB-5060 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-5060).",
    "Diverse cell types are produced from dorsal and ventral regions of the developing neural tube. In this study we describe a system for generating human inhibitory interneurons by ventralizing human embryonic stem cells in vitro and characterizing the gene expression of the cell types produced over time. We engineered a DCX-Citrine/Y hESC line to sort and characterize progenitor and neuron transcriptomics separately at both the subpopulation and single cell level. The cells generated in vitro were compared to similar populations present in human fetal brain samples by mapping gene expression data from human fetal cells onto the principal component analysis (PCA) space of in vitro-derived populations. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to determine the discreet cell types present at D24, D54, D100 and D125 of culture, and describe the gene expression changes that occur in progenitor and neuron populations over time. Immature lateral ganglionic eminence and medial ganglionic eminence cells are present at early timepoints, along with MGE-like and dorsal pallium-like neuronal progenitors. At later timepoints we observe the emergence of SST-expressing interneurons, as well as oligodendrocyte and astrocyte progenitors. We also identified genes that were upregulated in somatostatin-expressing interneurons as they mature. The transcriptomes of 1732 ventralized single cells were profiled by SmartSeq2 at different timepoints throughout a 125-day differentiation protocol that converted H1 human embryonic stem cells to a variety of ventrally-derived cell types.",
    "Cortex, hippocampus, and subventricular zone were purchased from BrainBits (C57EHCV). They were from 2 E18 C57BL/6 mice dissected on the same day, shipped overnight on ice, and stored at 4C until being prepared for scRNA-Seq. Brain tissues were dissociated following the Demonstrated Protocol for Mouse Embryonic Neural Tissue (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell/sample-prep/doc/demonstrated-protocol-dissociation-of-mouse-embryonic-neural-tissue-for-single-cell-rna-sequencing). 69 scRNA-Seq libraries were made from first mouse brain 2 days after the dissection. Another 64 scRNA-Seq libraries were made from second mouse brain 6 days after the dissection.",
    "Diverse cells of the immune system maintain and protect tissue function, integrity, and homeostasis upon changes in functional demands and diverse perturbations. Recent advances such as massively parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing and sophisticated computational methods help shed new light on this complexity. This immune cell census aims to profile up to 2M immunocytes, the first tranche of this is currently available. With computational methods optimized to a massive scale, we can readily identify cell types and markers, as well as the process of hematopoietic differentiation. The high quality and comprehensive reference map is provided as an open community resource for understanding human health and disease.",
    "CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4-CTLs) have been reported to play a protective role in several viral infections. However, little is known in humans about the biology of CD4-CTL generation, their functional properties, heterogeneity and clonal diversity, especially in relation to other well-described CD4+ memory T cell subsets. We performed single-cell RNA-seq in over 9000 cells to unravel CD4-CTL heterogeneity, transcriptional profile and clonality in humans. The single-cell differential gene expression analysis, revealed a spectrum of known transcripts, including several linked to cytotoxic and co-stimulatory function, and transcripts of unknown cytotoxicity-related function that are expressed at higher levels in the TEMRA subset, which is highly enriched for CD4-CTLs, compared to cells in the central and effector memory subsets (TCM, TEM). Simultaneous T cells antigen receptor (TCR) analysis in single-cells and bulk subsets revealed that CD4-TEMRA cells show marked clonal expansion compared to TCM and TEM cells and that the majority of CD4-TEMRA were dengue virus (DENV)-specific in subjects with previous DENV infection. The profile of CD4-TEMRA was highly heterogeneous across subjects, with four distinct clusters identified by the single-cell analysis. Most importantly, we identified distinct clusters of CD4-CTL effector and precursor cells in the TEMRA subset; the precursor cells shared TCR clonotypes with CD4-CTL effectors and were distinguished by high expression of the interleukin-7 receptor. Our identification of a CD4-CTL precursor population may allow further investigation of how CD4-CTLs arise in humans and thus could provide insights into the mechanisms that may be utilized to generate durable and effective CD4-CTL immunity.",
    "The purpose of this project is to assess the relevance of pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral and liver organoids to recapitulate the variation in cell-type specific gene expression programs between individuals. Towards this aim, we will generate reference atlases of the developing cortex and liver from multiple individuals, derive iPSC lines from these same individuals, and determine if inter-individual gene expression variation is recapitulated in cerebral and liver organoids from the same individual from which we have reference maps. In parallel we will assess the genetic contribution to variablity between organoids from different iPSCs of multiple human individuals that are available in existing iPSC resources (e.g. HipSci).",
    "Differentiation is among the most fundamental processes in cell biology. Single cell RNA-seq studies have demonstrated that differentiation is a continuous process and in particular cell states are observed to reside on largely continuous spaces. We have developed Palantir, a graph based algorithm to model continuities in cell state transitions and cell fate choices. Modeling differentiation as a Markov chain, Palantir determines probabilities of reaching terminal states from cells in each intermediate state. The entropy of these probabilities represent the differentiation potential of the cell in the corresponding state. Applied to single cell RNA-seq dataset of CD34+ hematopoietic cells from human bone marrows, Palantir accurately identified key events leading up to cell fate commitment. Integration with ATAC-seq data from bulk sorted populations helped identify key regulators that correlate with cell fate specification and commitment.",
    "Assessment of ischaemic sensitivity of human tissues using 10x 3' single cell RNA sequencing. Currently, this project contains data for spleen and oesophagus. Ultimately we aim to collect data from three tissues expected to have different sensitivity to ischaemia: spleen (expected least sensitive), oesophagus (in the middle), and lung. Samples will be collected fresh (i.e. as soon as possible) and at 12h, 24h, and 72h post onset of ischaemia in the donor. Single cell RNA sequencing data will be generated at each time point using the 10x genomics single cell 3' method.",
    "Q4_DEMO-We report transcriptomes from 430 single glioblastoma cells isolated from 5 individual tumors and 102 single cells from gliomasphere cells lines generated using SMART-seq. In addition, we report population RNA-seq from the five tumors as well as RNA-seq from cell lines derived from 3 tumors (MGH26, MGH28, MGH31) cultured under serum free (GSC) and differentiated (DGC) conditions. This dataset highlights intratumoral heterogeneity with regards to the expression of de novo derived transcriptional modules and established subtype classifiers. Overall design: Operative specimens from five glioblastoma patients (MGH26, MGH28, MGH29, MGH30, MGH31) were acutely dissociated, depleted for CD45+ inflammatory cells and then sorted as single cells (576 samples). Population controls for each tumor were isolated by sorting 2000-10000 cells and processed in parallel (5 population control samples). Single cells from two established cell lines, GBM6 and GBM8, were also sorted as single cells (192 samples). SMART-seq protocol was implemented to generate single cell full length transcriptomes (modified from Shalek, et al Nature 2013) and sequenced using 25 bp paired end reads. Single cell cDNA libraries for MGH30 were resequenced using 100 bp paired end reads to allow for isoform and splice junction reconstruction (96 samples, annotated MGH30L). Cells were also cultured in serum free conditions to generate gliomasphere cell lines for MGH26, MGH28, and MGH31 (GSC) which were then differentiated using 10% serum (DGC). Population RNA-seq was performed on these samples (3 GSC, 3 DGC, 6 total). The initial dataset included 875 RNA-seq libraries (576 single glioblastoma cells, 96 resequenced MGH30L, 192 single gliomasphere cells, 5 tumor population controls, 6 population libraries from GSC and DGC samples). Data was processed as described below using RSEM for quantification of gene expression. 5,948 genes with the highest composite expression either across all single cells combined (average log2(TPM)>4.5) or within a single tumor (average log2(TPM)>6 in at least one tumor) were included. Cells expressing less than 2,000 of these 5,948 genes were excluded. The final processed dataset then included 430 primary single cell glioblastoma transcriptomes, 102 single cell transcriptomes from cell lines(GBM6,GBM8), 5 population controls (1 for each tumor), and 6 population libraries from cell lines derived from the tumors (GSC and DGC for MGH26, MGH28 and MGH31). The final matrix (GBM_data_matrix.txt) therefore contains 5948 rows (genes) quantified in 543 samples (columns). Please note that the samples which are not included in the data processing are indicated in the sample description field.",

    "Single cell genomics are revolutionizing our ability to characterize complex tissues. By contrast, the techniques used to analyze the renal biopsy are little changed over the past several decades. In this study we have tested the hypothesis that single cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) can comprehensively describe cell types and states in a human kidney biopsy. We generated 8,746 single cell cell transcriptomes from a healthy adult kidney and a single kidney transplant biopsy core by sc-RNA-seq. Unsupervised clustering analysis of the biopsy identified 16 distinct cell types, including all of the major immune cell types and most native kidney cell types in this biopsy whose histologic read was mixed rejection. Endothelial cells formed three distinct sub-clusters: resting cells and two activated endothelial cell clusters, including expression of Fc-receptor pathway activation and immunoglobulin internalization genes, consistent with the pathologic diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection. Monocytes formed two sub-clusters representing a non-classical CD16+ group and a classical CD16- group expressing dendritic cell maturation markers. The presence of both monocyte cell subtypes was validated by staining of of independent transplant biopsies. Comparison of healthy kidney epithelial transcriptomes to their biopsy counterparts identified novel segment specific pro-inflammatory responses. We mapped previously defined genes that associate with rejection outcomes to single cell types and generated a searchable online gene expression database. These findings represent a first step towards incorporation of single cell transcriptomics into kidney biopsy interpretation, describe a heterogeneous immune response in mixed rejection and provide a searchable resource for the scientific community.",
    "Despite rapid developments in single cell sequencing technology, sample-specific batch effects, detection of cell doublets, and the cost of generating massive datasets remain outstanding challenges. Here, we introduce cell hashing, where oligo-tagged antibodies against ubiquitously expressed surface proteins are used to uniquely label cells from distinct samples, which can be subsequently pooled. By sequencing these tags alongside the cellular transcriptome, we can assign each cell to its sample of origin, and robustly identify doublets originating from multiple samples. We demonstrate our approach by pooling eight human PBMC samples on a single run of the 10x Chromium system, substantially reducing our per-cell costs for library generation. Cell hashing is inspired by, and complementary to, elegant multiplexing strategies based on genetic variation, which we also leverage to validate our results. We therefore envision that our approach will help to generalize the benefits of single cell multiplexing to diverse samples and experimental designs.",
    "The Human Cell Atlas project seeks to identify and functionally characterize all cell types in the human body. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods quantify gene expression in individual cells. In principle, highly parallelized scRNA-seq approaches enable marker-free decomposition of cells from complex tissues to identify known and unknown cell types and provide direct insights into regulatory and functional states of each cell. Different scRNA-seq technologies vary in cell capture efficiency, library preparation, and throughput. Importantly, these approaches also vary in sensitivity and accuracy of mRNA quantification. The Human Cell Atlas project will collate data generated across many labs, necessitating the evaluation of experimental replicability, and comparing different experimental procedures. It is important to develop robust sequencing protocols and benchmark their performance on select cells and tissues. This project will perform a systematic comparison of three single cell RNA sequencing technologies, viz., Drop-Seq, Fluidigm C1, and DroNC-Seq and resulting datasets. Droplet-based methods facilitate high-throughput processing of tens of thousands of cells in parallel and at low costs, making them ideal for the Human Cell Atlas project. This project proposes to compare the sensitivity, accuracy, and precision with which the three methods quantify transcript levels within individual cells. In addition, this project will directly compare these methods using a \u2018synthetic tissue\u2019 created from a mixture of multiple cell types at known ratios.",

    "Islets were dissociated into single-cell suspension and viable individual cells were distributed by FACS into 384-well plates containing lysis buffer.",
    "To generate single cell suspensions, hESC-derived cultures were dissociated from plates using Accutase (ThermoFisher) at 37C. Light trituration using a P1000 pipette was done every 5 min until nearly all clumps had been dissociated (up to 1 h). Cell suspension was washed and filtered through a 40 um cell strainer. Cells were washed in PBS with 1% FBS and stained with 0.5-1 ug/mL DAPI. Single-cell suspensions were loaded onto a FACSAria II SORP (Becton Dickinson) and sorted directly into PCR strip tubes or plates held in chilled aluminium blocks. Doublets and dead cells were excluded based on forward scatter, side scatter and DAPI fluorescence. Sorting was done using the 130 um nozzle with the sort mode set to single cell. Accuracy of single-cell sorts was confirmed by sorting DAPI-stained fixed cells onto a dry well of a 96-well plate and analyzing by fluorescence microscopy.",

The renal biopsy was minced into small pieces with a razor blade and incubated at 37 \u02daC in freshly prepared dissociation buffer containing 0.25% trypsin and 40 U/ml DNase I. Dissociated cells were harvested every 10 min by filtering the cell suspension through a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer (pluriSelect) into 10% FBS buffer on ice. The residual biopsy tissue trapped on the cell strainer was dissociated once again with 1 mL dissociation buffer for 10 min, passed through cell strainer into the same FBS buffer from the first collection. We repeated this dissociation procedure three times until most of the tissue had been dissociated into single cells (total dissociation time was 30 min). Finally, cells were collected by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min, resuspended in inDrops cell suspension buffer (9% Optiprep) and strained through a 40 \u00b5m cell mesh (pluriSelect) to further remove cell clumps and large fragments.",

The mRNA is reverse-transcribed to generate the first cDNA strand and treated with exonuclease I to remove leftover RT primers. Next, the cellular lysates are pooled together and converted to double-stranded cDNA. The DNA strands are transcribed to RNA and treated with DNase to remove leftover DNA templates in the mixture. The RNA strands are fragmented and annealed to sequencing adapters, followed by RT to generate barcoded cDNA libraries that are ready for sequencing."
